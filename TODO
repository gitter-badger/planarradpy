In the code, there is some comments in green about how to improve the GUI.

But some tasks were not done, such as :
- Display on the graphic the wavelength numbers using in the result file.
- Check the unit test file for the batch fil because I really not sure that is works well.
- Create a unit test file for the main file.
- On the graphic, put the name of the file where data for results come from.
- Add a dialogBox for when you click on the cross to close the window.
- For the report parameter, add a list with all available.
- OPen the documentation adn the log file thanks to the bar menu.

Some ideas from me could be implement :
- Add an embed python console / terminal in the GUI showing how PlanarRad works.
- Programing a dynamic resize
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Give the possibility to the user to change how to display results (curves, dots ...)
- Become dynamic information about curves and results, about the inputs given to plot results.
- Create two files when we will program the second tab (one file for each).
